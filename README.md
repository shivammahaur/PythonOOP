Basically an intro to python classes and class structure.

### Learnings

- Python has 9 things you work with:

    ```python
    a = 4
    b = 5
    c = [6, 7]

    d = "Hi"
    "Hello"

    def area(x):
        return x**2

    area(3)
    ```

    From the above code :-

    | Syntax | Description |
    | ------ | ----------- |
    | Objects | 4, 5, [6, 7], 6, 7, "Hello" |
    | Identifiers | a, b, c, d, area, x |
    | Operators | **, *, -, +, / etc. |
    | Delimiters | =, " ( ) : [ ] |
    | Keywords | def, return |
    | Comments | # Code starting with hash |
    | Blank Lines | As the name suggests |
    | White Spaces | -do- |
